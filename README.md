## Description

A nvim setup original posted by [slydragonn](https://github.com/slydragonn) which I tweaked for my own needs. 

Link to slydragonn's repository with dotfiles: [slydragonn/dotfiles](https://github.com/slydragonn/dotfiles) (nvim files are in .config/ repository).
They even have a video tutorial where they showed how to set it up: [ My Neovim Setup for Windows and Linux with Lua and Packer | Inspired by @devaslife ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkCnPdaRBE0&t=901s).
